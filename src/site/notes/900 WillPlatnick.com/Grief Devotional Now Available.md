I’m humbled to announce that my devotional, “Sitting in Grief: A Devotional Journey Towards Standing Again” is [now available](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/19799) on YouVersion.

I wrote this devotional in the midst of my grief while unpacking what I was going through with the death of my father, along with various tidbits I had stashed away after the deaths of my mom and my son.

I’m not 100% happy with how it turned out, because grief can hit people in such different ways and there’s so much more to say about grief than can be contained in five days. I pray that it will simply be a lifeline when someone feels like they’re drowning.

If this reading plan was useful to you, please consider filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedUiV1-iqyRL6Glc250JDae0CaxsM9hVIoYJUIXLLw0A4NUg/viewform?usp=sf_link) so I can pray for you.
